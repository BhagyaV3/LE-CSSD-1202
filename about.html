        <h3><i>What is an Ecological Footprint?</i></h3>
        <p>The ecological footprint is a model used to quantify the consumption and <br> demands placed on local natural resources by communities and the people in them. <br>
            (It should not be confused with the carbon footprint as the ecological footprint <br> involves natrual resourses other than just carbon).
        </p>
        <h3><i>What is ECOfooTracker?</i></h3>
        <p>ECOfooTracker is a free, online, application where users can track and optimize <br> their ecological footprints, therefore being more mindful of their daily <br> 
            activities in support of our environments and many of the living beings in them!
        </p>
        <h3><i>Who Are We?</i></h3>
        <p>We are 3 students attending the Computer Science for Software Development Program (BASc) <br> at the new Markham Campus of York University, Canada. <br>
            This is actually our first website, which we'll be developing over the course of a semester for one of our courses. <br> 
            You can see our contact information on the Contact page. <br>
            It's our privilege to be using web development towards addressing an issue that's been affecting our world for so long!
