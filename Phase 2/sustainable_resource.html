            <p><i>Ecological Footprint</i></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Know that you can make a difference; small things such as walking and biking creates a huge impact</li>
                <li>Reduce, reuse, recycle; purchase items that are long-lasting, has the potential to be reused and can be recycled or donated such as reusable water battles</li>
                <li>Check where your money is going; Think about the impact of purchasing products/services and its impact on the enviorment</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fast fashion causes huge amounts of cheap clothes in the landfill</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Look at what you're eating; have designated days where you go vegan such as meatless Monday's</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Agriculture accounts for 23% of greenhouse gases and 60% from meat production </li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Unplug; reduce the amount of energy usage in your home by unplugging devices when not in use</li>
                <li>Be efficient; Make sure to plan ahead to avoid burning too much gasoline</li>
                <li>Speak up; Share, inform and educate others about ecological footprints</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Sustainable Consumption</h5>
            <p>According to the UN sustainable consumption is about doing more and better with less. It's about separating economic growth from the destruction of the environment, increasing the amount of resources and promoting sustainable lifestyles. Additionally, it is about decreasing the amount of natural resources used and minimizing emissions of pollutants released. We are consuming large amounts of resources and hence exceeding the planet's capacity. </p>
            <p>We must change the way we consume because we have been causing environmental destruction and endangering the systems that our future is based on. One change is for governments to put policy into action that can set targets for reducing waste, promoting practices such as reducing, reusing and recycling. Another change is moving to a circular economy which means making products that can be repaired and recycled. Furthermore, another change is for people to adapt to sustainable lifestyles. This includes consuming less, choosing products with lower environmental impact and reducing one’s carbon footprint. Reducing waste and being aware of what you're purchasing and choosing the sustainable options are only a few ways that can make a difference. </p>

            <h4>11 Simple Ways to Reduce Your Ecological Footprint</h4>

            <p><i>Solar Panel on a roof - Renewable energy</i></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Get rid of single-use plastic; plastic takes a significant amount of time to decompse and by reducing this will allow a decreased amount of plastic in landfills</li>
                <li>Renewable energy; This type of energy does not release greenhouse gases</li>
                <li>Consume more plant based food; eating food that is sustainably created has a low enviormental impact</li>
                <li>Avoid using fossil fuels such as gasoline; try to take public transit or other methods of transportation that does not burn fossil fuels</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Waste Reduction</h5>
            <p>According to the United Nations, non-liquid waste that is created by an individual, small business etc. would grow from 2.1 billion tonnes in 2023 to 3.8 billion tons per year by 2050. Putting sustainable practices into action is essential to avoid such staggering numbers. 

                Here are ways to reduce waste:
                
                Refuse items unless you're sure that they will be used. For example, saying no to receipts, bags or cutlery. Reusable items such as reusable bags should be used over single use items. Try to repurpose things that you may decide to throw away. For example, reusing a jam container for storage. 
                
                Try to swap items instead of purchasing them. Considering to borrow or share items that are not used as often can prevent getting new ones. For example, lending people a lawn mower once in a while. Repairing items such as clothing rather than throwing them away. 
                
                Consciously shopping helps one make better choices and purchases. This includes planning ahead before buying. Donating items that you were about to throw away or donating things that will not be used. </p>
            <h5>Reducing single-use plastics</h5>
            <p>The creation of plastic contributes to climate change. Microplastics take years to degrade and endangers the organisms living there. </p>
            <h5>Avoid Fast Fashion</h5>
            <p>This is the rapid production of clothing. This requires large amounts of natural resources. Fast fashion then results in clothes being quickly discarded. Millions of clothing end up in landfills. </p>
            <h5>Go Digital</h5>
            <p>Reduce your paper waste. For example, moving from online snail mail to emails. The overall energy usage of digital devices is much lower than on printed material.</p>
