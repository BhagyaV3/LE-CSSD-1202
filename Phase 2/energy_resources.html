    <h1><u>Energy and Transportation Choices</u></h1>
    <p class="startC">Here is more information on how one can reduce their ecological footprint!</p>
    <br>
    <section>
        <h4>‘Everyone has an impact’: how to start reducing your environmental footprint - The Guardian</h4>
        <img src="style/photos/Biking.jpg" width="900" height="400" alt="Biking" style="border: 5px solid black">
        <br><h5><i>Biking is an enviorment friendly way of transportation</i></h5>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Calculate your carbon footprint; this allows you to understand where you can reduce your ecological footprint</p></li>
            <li><p>Transportation; consider taking transportation that avoids burning fossil fuels that both impacts the enviorment and reduces traffic congestion</p></li>
            <li><p>Air travel; Avoid flying if possible on shorter trips to avoid emitting fewer greenhouse gases</p></li>
            <li><p>Be politically active; govermental action is key in reducing your ecological footprint - Make sure to vote!</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Turn unused Electronic Devices off</h5>
        <p>This includes unplugging devices such as televisions, computers, and video game consoles. Chargers for cell phones and other handheld devices also take a considerable amount of energy, even when it's not being used for charging purposes. Additionally, when one charges their handheld devices overnight and reaches the maximum charge it degrades the battery life. Computers can be set to sleep mode which uses less power than when they are active. One should skip screensavers as they still use power. A better alternative is to switch them off when not in use.
        </p>
        <h5>Avoid using more Energy than what's needed
        </h5>
        <p>For example, avoid running the dishwasher when it's not entirely full of dishes. It's better to wait until the dishwasher is full of dishes, to maximise its usage of energy. In terms of washing machines try using cold water instead of hot since it takes more energy to heat the water. A clothes dryer is one of the largest energy users in the home. If it's a warm day, attempt to air-dry clothing whenever possible. When the clothes dryer is the only option, make sure to clean the lint filter after each use. 
        </p>
        <h5>Measure your Electricity
        </h5>
        <p>Monitoring your electricity usage can help you make more energy saving decisions. For example, if you find that your dryer takes a considerable amount of energy when compared to other electronics, you may be able to find other alternatives. Monitors such as a Kill A Watt meter can be installed to monitor your usage of electricity.
        </p>
        <h5>Seal up Cracks
        </h5>
        <p>If one were to add up all the gaps around windows and doors in their house, they would have a 3-foot by 3-foot hole in the wall. Utilizing weather-strip and window putty to seal gaps allows one to stop heated or cooled air from escaping. This conserves the desired room temperature and avoids the use of air conditioning. Replacing old windows can make huge differences and save a considerable amount of energy. 
        </p>
        <h5>Shopping Smarter
        </h5>
        <p>Many new and updated appliances use half the energy of appliances used 2 decades ago. Whenever shopping for appliances look for products with the energy star label. These types of appliances consume 10-40% less energy than other appliances. Furthermore, these appliances have many rebates provided by the government. Laptops use less energy than desktops. Replace old shower heads with new low-flow designs which help prevent loss of excess hot water and the energy needed to heat it.
        </p>
        <h5>Make the Choice of Renewable Energy
        </h5>
        <p>Choose energy suppliers that use renewable resources such as solar, hydroelectric, geothermal or wind power. For further information, ask your electricity supplier for more available options.

        <h4>Energy efficiency for transportation and alternative fuels</h4>
        <img src="style/photos/electric_vehicles.jpg" width="900" height="400" alt="Electric vehicles" style="border: 5px solid black">
        <p><i>Electric vehicles</i></p>

        <ul>
            <li>Electric charging; Be aware of where electric charging stations</li>
            <li>Fuel consumption; Try to be aware of your fuel consumption and use the most fuel-efficent vehicle that meets your needs</li>
            <li>Personal vehicles; Consider getting fuel-efficient vehicles and learn fuel-efficent driving techniques</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>How does the choice of transportation have an impact on the environment? 
        </h5>
        <p>Many transportation vehicles are fueled by petrol or diesel which are non-renewable fossil fuels. In other words, this source of energy will run out and can not be reused. These fossil fuels release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. This contributes to climate change and causes pollution which is a health risk. Planes and petrol or diesel cars release the most carbon emissions. 
        </p>
        <h5>Alternatives</h5>
        <p>Public transport is an environmentally friendly way of transport. Although most use fossil fuels, it’s able to carry multiple passengers at once. They produce less emissions than an average person with a vehicle. Additionally, some means of transport run on electricity such as TTC buses in Toronto, Canada. Electric bikes and scooters are a better alternative as they run electricity. Common bikes and scooters that are powered by people are the least harmful for the environment as they produce less greenhouse gases. 
        </p>
        <h5>Reducing Impact of Cars on the Environment
        </h5>
        <p>Try to make shorter journeys by foot, bus, or bike. This cuts the amount of air pollution. Many people drive alone or with a few passengers. Driving with people who are going to the same destination reduces emissions by half. One vehicle on the road is way better than more than one. Switching to hybrid or fully electric vehicles is also a better way of transportation. They don't produce carbon emissions or pollute the air. When they are charged from renewable resources, it cuts down on emissions as well.
